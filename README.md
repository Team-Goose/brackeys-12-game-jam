## Theme: Calm before the Storm

Our idea is to make a game about a tree frog trying to climb to the top of a giant rainforest tree. Various places on the tree are better to grab, and sometimes a storm comes through and tries to blow you off of the tree. You have to be holding onto a good enough spot or be at a checkpoint for the storm not to blow you off.
